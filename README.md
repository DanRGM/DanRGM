- Hi, I’m @DanRGM
- I’m an avid shitposter, and unity decompiler.
- I’m currently learning how to deal with post depression withdrawal, and how to use unity.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that needs decompiling.
- Reach me at Dan_RGM@protonmail.com for any legal concerns, collaborations, etc.
